The Depot is a light weight server that does not handle world implementations.  This is used for Signal connections, dummy server, and development purposes. 
This is the first server to be developed for ProtOasis. 

This server will allow Signal development and testing against a real server.

This server will use UDP for UT3 compatible Query protocol, TCP for data transmission, and eventually RSVP and SCTP protocols for testing.
